# Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus

This is an expermental decompilation of Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus for the PlayStation 2. The project is based on the NTSC-U version of the game (SCUS-971.98).

The goal of this project is to better understand how the game works. This repo does not contain any game assets or original code from the game's executable.

## Beginner's Guide

First, clone the repo to your PC. Then open Visual Studio, click `File > Open > CMake...`, and open the file `CMakeLists.txt`.

To compile and run, make sure your startup item is `test.exe (Sly1Decomp\src\test.exe)`. This will build the project and execute the tests in `main.cpp.`
