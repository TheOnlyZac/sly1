This is a work-in-progress, experimental decompilation of *Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus* for the PlayStation 2. It is based on the NTSC-U version of the game (`SCUS-971.98`).

The goal of this project is to better understand how the game works. **This repo does not contain any game assets or original code from the game's executable.**

New contributors are welcome and encouraged to make a pull request!

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is a decompilation?
When the developers created the game, they wrote programming code that we call the source code. Then, they compiled the code into machine code that can run on the PS2. Our job is to disasemble that code and reverse engineer it to re-create the original code. This process is called decompilation, and it leaves us with code that is very similar (but not identical) to the source code.

#### How does it work?
We use a tool called [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) which was created by the [NSA](https://www.nsa.gov/) for reverse-engineering software. Ghidra does a lot of the work for us by auto-decompiling the assembly code in the game's executable to human-readable C code. This auto-decompiled code is messy and has a lot of mistakes, so we use it as a base. We look at each individual function, clean it up, add variable names, fix data types, and finally re-write the code in C++.

#### Has this ever been done before?
We are not aware of any other major PS2 decompilation projects. However, this project is inspired by other projects such as the [Super Mario 64 decomp](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64) for the N64 and the [Breath of the Wild decomp](https://github.com/zeldaret/botw) for the Wii U. The latter is more similar in scope to what we are trying to do.

#### Is this a matching decomp?
We are not currently aiming for a matching decomp due to the added complexity and lack of resources/info on PS2 reverse-engineering. However, this is subject to change if/when we learn more and come up with a process for function matching.

#### How can I help?
See below for instructions on how to download the project and start writing code.

## Getting Started

### Windows - Visual Studio

*Prerequisites: C++ CMake tools for Windows*

Clone the repo and open Visual Studio. Click `File > Open > CMake...` and open the file `CMakeLists.txt` in the main project folder. To build and run the main test program, set your startup item to `main.exe`.

For unit testing, build the target "Check" and the tests should appear in the Test Explorer window. It will run the tests, and the results will show in the Test Explorer as well as the Output window.

### Windows/Unix - MSYS2 MINGW64/UCRT64 - GNU/Linux

*Prerequisites: gcc (optionally clang), cmake, ninja, git, and base-devel*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheOnlyZac/sly1
cd sly1
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . -j8
```

For testing, cd into the build directory and run `cmake --build . --target check` or `make check` to build the tests. Then run the tests with `ctest -C Debug`.

## Style Guide

### General

Our goal is to imitate the original source code as closely as possible based on the debug symbols from the [May 2002 prototype](https://hiddenpalace.org/Sly_Cooper_and_the_Thievius_Raccoonus_(May_19,_2002_prototype)). Please try to follow these guidelines when writing your code:
* Use official names from the debug symbols wherever possible.
* Indent with tabs, not spaces
* Put project includes before library includes.

### Symbol Names

For the most part, variables are named according to [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation). The following prefixes are used to denote the type of a variable/symbol:
* `p` - Pointer
* `n` - Integer/number
* `c` - Integer/count of items
* `f` - Boolean/flag
* `l` - Long
* `u` - Unsigned float
* `b` - Byte
* `ch` - Char
* `z` - Zero-terminated string
* `C` - Class name

The following prefixes are used to denote the scope of a variable:
* `g_` - Global variable
* `m_` - Member of class (does not apply to structs)
* `s_` - Static member of class

Here are some examples of variable names that combine the above prefixes:
* `ccoin`, `clife`, `ccharm` - Count of coins, lives, and charms
* `fSneakyFeet` - Flag that denotes whether Sly's footsteps make guitar noises
* `g_pgsCur` - Global pointer to the game's current GS struct
* `g_pchzArgs` - Global pointer to a zero-terminated char array of arguments
* `CBinaryInputStream` - Name of the class that handles reading data from binary streams
* `m_cbBulkData` - Member variable that stores the count of bytes in a data block

### Capitalization

Please try to stick to the following capitalization schemes:
* Use `ALLCAPS` for struct/enum names.
    * eg. `struct DIFFICULTY`, `enum class FLS`
* Use `UpperCamelCase` for function/class names and enum values.
    * eg. `void OnDifficultyGameLoad()`, `class CTransition`, `FCHT::InfiniteCharms`
* Use `lowerCamelCase` for local variables, function parameters, and class members.
    * eg. `char nextXorChar`, `Coin* pCoin`, `float m_rxScale`
