__Code Matching Guide for Sly1 Decompilation Project__
Works only on Windows for now.

**1. Clone the Sly1 Git repo.**
`git clone https://github.com/TheOnlyZac/sly1.git`

**2. Download and extract the PS2 compiler collection (25MB in size).**
`https://archive.org/download/SNSystemsProDGPs2/ProDGPs2usrLocalSceFiles.zip`
Extract it to your C:\ drive.
Once extracted, the path structure should look like: `C:\usr\local\sce\...`
If you were wondering why this step is needed, it will be useful for compiling our code (from the repo).
CodeMatcher will be able to match it against Sly1's original code.

**3. Get the Sly1 Prototype ELF.**
Find the Sly1 August Prototype ISO online, download it and extract the ELF to the tools folder in the repo. Or ask on Discord.
We cannot provide this file via the Git repo for copyright reasons.

**4. Decompile, code, sleep, repeat.**
Run match.cmd from the tools folder in the repo to compile the source tree and perform a function match.
A summary of the process will be displayed, including functions that do match and which do not.

If you have any questions, feel free to leave a message on Discord!

Have fun!
